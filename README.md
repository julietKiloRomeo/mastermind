# mastermind

We had a lot of fun playing an old mastermind game we found in a cabin in Norway during our vacation. After we came home I decided to write a solver to see what average score I should be aiming for if I play perfectly.

The small program will play itself when executed.

Just run it by:
```
(python3.6) > python mastermind.py
```
